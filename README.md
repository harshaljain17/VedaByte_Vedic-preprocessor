Project Description: 

Vedabyte: Vedic AI Preprocessor
Vedabyte is a high-performance data preprocessing engine designed to accelerate AI pipelines using ancient Vedic Mathematical Sutras. By replacing traditional, computationally expensive multiplication algorithms with Dwanda Yoga (Duplex) and Yavadunam techniques, Vedabyte reduces the arithmetic workload for normalization and feature scaling by up to 50% at the logic level.

The InnovationStandard AI preprocessing (like Z-score or L2 normalization) relies heavily on squaring operations ($x^2$). Modern processors use iterative multiplication (like Booth's algorithm), which is resource-intensive.

Vedabyte introduces a Hybrid Vedic Engine:

1. Dwanda Yoga (Duplex Method): A general-purpose algorithm that transforms squaring into a single-line symmetric multiplication pattern, reducing gate delays.

2. Yavadunam Sutra: A specialist algorithm that provides near-instant squaring for numbers close to powers of 10 (bases).

3. Smart Selection Logic: The engine dynamically chooses the most efficient Sutra based on the input data's proximity to a mathematical base.

Technical Stack

1. Backend: Python 3.13 with Numba (@njit) for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to machine code, achieving C-level execution speeds.

2. Frontend: React + Vite for a lightning-fast, minimalist developer dashboard.

3. Communication: Flask API with CORS integration.

4. Visualization: Recharts (React) and Matplotlib (Python) for real-time algorithmic performance tracking.
